## Guidelines

3 deuren - een voor elk level
voor elke deur aparte code

puzzel wordt moeilijker met elke level
elke deur heeft een hint

elk level heeft meer en meer puzzels waarvan alle het antwoord nodig is om de
code voor de deur van de level te ontcijveren.

Semi-text based.

## Verhaal

You glitched out of reality to a place called the backrooms, and you are looking
for a way out. If you somehow get lucky (or unlucky) enough to reach the 
Backrooms, you'll most likely find yourself in Level 0.

In every level you have a door and every door needs a passphrase to open but
you have to solve the puzzels first to get the passphrase.

In level 0 you have only one puzzle to solve to find the passphrase to go to
the next level.
In level 1 you have two puzzels to solve to find the passphrase to go to the 
next level.
In Level 2 you have four puzzels to solve to find the passphrase to go to the
master level.
In master level you need to add sum all the passphrases and solve the last 
puzzle to finish and get out of the backrooms

## Thema

Office building that is abandoned yet still connected to the electric grid.

Ominous due to lack of people, odd noises, and permanent hum of fluorescent
lightbulbs.

Some areas of the "office complex" are dimly lit or not lit at all.
